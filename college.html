<h1>LIST IN HTML</h1>
<h3>ORDERED LIST</h3>
<p>An ordered list in HTML is a list of items where the sequence or order of the items is significant. It is used when the arrangement of the list items is important, such as in step-by-step instructions, rankings, or chronological events</p>

<tr>
<ol>
<li>numeric</li>
<li>capital alphabet</li>
<li>small alphabet</li>
</ol>
</tr>

<h3>UNORDERED LIST</h3>
<p>
An unordered list in HTML is used to present a collection of items where the order of the items is not significant. These lists are typically displayed with bullet points by default.
</p>
<tr>
<ul>
<li>disc</li>
<li>square</li>
<li>circle</li>
</ul>
</tr>

<h3>DISCRIPTION LIST</h3>
<p>
An HTML description list, also known as a definition list, is used to display a list of terms and their corresponding descriptions or definitions. It is particularly useful for presenting glossaries, FAQs, or any content where a term is followed by its explanation.
